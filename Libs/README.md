<div id='laplace-lib'/>

#### **LAPLACE LIB**

**Laplace Lib Library v1.0.0** is a comprehensive C library that offers a wide range of functions for various common programming tasks. Designed for ease of use and seamless integration into diverse projects, this library is a valuable resource for C developers. It is developed and maintained by MasterLaplace.

Key features of Laplace Lib Library include:
- **String Manipulation**: Functions like `laplace_lib_count_char` to count occurrences of a character in a string, `laplace_lib_getnbr` for extracting numbers from strings, and `laplace_lib_is_number` to check if a string is numeric.
- **File Handling**: The library provides `laplace_lib_open_file` to open files with customizable access flags.
- **String Operations**: Functions such as `laplace_lib_replace_char` for replacing characters in strings and `laplace_lib_strcat` for string concatenation.
- **Array Management**: It offers the ability to free 2D arrays of strings using `laplace_lib_two_free`, along with functions for obtaining the length of 2D arrays and printing them.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The library includes appropriate header files based on the platform in use.

The Laplace Lib Library is distributed under the MIT License, making it accessible for various applications. It is version **1.0.0**, and this documentation was last updated on **October 13, 2023**.


<div id='laplace-link'/>

#### **LAPLACE LINK**

**Laplace Link Library v1.0.0** is a C library that introduces a user-friendly linked list data structure implementation. This library simplifies the creation, appending, and removal of links in a list, as well as applying functions to each link, sorting the list, and printing its contents. It is developed and maintained by MasterLaplace.

Key features of Laplace Link Library include:
- **Linked List Structure**: The library defines the `link_t` struct to represent individual links in the linked list.
- **Link Operations**: Functions like `laplace_link_create` to create links with objects, `laplace_link_append` for adding links to the list, and `laplace_link_remove` for removing links from the list.
- **List Operations**: Functions for duplicating lists, checking if a link is null, determining the size of the list, and obtaining links by index or by the object they contain.
- **Sorting and Swapping**: It provides functions for sorting the list based on custom comparison functions and for swapping links within the list.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The library includes appropriate header files based on the platform in use.

<div id='laplace-map'/>

#### **LAPLACE MAP**

**Laplace Map Library v1.0.0** is a C library that introduces a user-friendly hash map data structure implementation. This library simplifies the creation, insertion, and removal of key-value pairs in a map, as well as applying functions to each pair, sorting the map, and printing its contents. It is developed and maintained by MasterLaplace.

Key features of Laplace Map Library include:
- **Hash Map Structure**: The library defines the `map_t` struct to represent individual key-value pairs in the hash map.
- **Map Operations**: Functions like `laplace_map_create` to create maps with objects, `laplace_map_append` for adding pairs to the map, and `laplace_map_remove` for removing pairs from the map.
- **List Operations**: Functions for checking if a pair is null, determining the size of the map, and obtaining pairs by the key they contain.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The library includes appropriate header files based on the platform in use.
