## :pencil: **DESCRIPTION**

#### **LIB MY**

The **MY** library is a C library that provides a collection of functions for common string and file operations, as well as some utility functions for checking system endianness and searching lists of characters.<br>

The library is composed of a single header file, `lib.h`, which defines various functions for working with strings and files. The library also includes a version string, **LIB_MY_VERSION**, which can be used to track the version of the library being used.<br>

Some of the key functions provided by the **MY** library include `count_char` for counting the number of occurrences of a character in a string, `getnbr` for extracting an integer from a string, `is_number` for checking if a string is a number, `open_file` for opening a file with a specified set of flags, `replace_char` for replacing a character in a string with another character, and `my_strcat` for concatenating two strings. Additionally, the library provides a `two_free` function for freeing a 2D array of strings, as well as a `stwa` function for splitting a string into an array of strings based on a specified delimiter.<br>

Overall, the **MY** library is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing C projects, providing a useful set of string and file manipulation functions for a variety of applications.<br>

#### **LIB LINK**

The **LINK** library is a C library that provides a simple linked list data structure implementation. It allows users to easily create, append, and remove links from a list, as well as apply a function to each link, sort the list, and print its contents.<br>

The library is composed of a single header file, `link.h`, which defines the `link_t` struct and provides functions for working with linked lists. The library also includes a version string, **LIB_LINK_VERSION**, which can be used to track the version of the library being used.<br>

Overall, the **LINK** library is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing C projects, providing a basic yet flexible linked list implementation that can be used in a wide variety of applications.<br>
